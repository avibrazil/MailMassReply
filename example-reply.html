<p>Hello {sendername}</p>

<p>This message was sent to you because your message to me was put into an IMAP folder on the recepient.</p>

Here is a list of tokens that can be used throughout the message body (as `{{token}}`) that were extracted from the original message:

<ul>
    <li>from</li>
    <li>date</li>
    <li>to</li>
    <li>replyto</li>
    <li>sendername</li>
    <li>subject</li>
    <li>hash - unique hash calculated from sender, date, subject; can be used on links to track interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'll use them to create a personalized phrase like this:</p>

<p>This is a reply to a message from {from}, sent on {date} to {to} and asking for reply on {replyto}.<p>

<p>Best,<br/>
