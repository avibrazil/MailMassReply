Hello {sendername}

This message was sent to you because your message to me was put into an IMAP folder on the recepient.

Here is a list of tokens that can be used throughout the message body (as `{{token}}`) that were extracted from the original message:

- from
- date
- to
- replyto
- sendername
- subject
- hash - unique hash calculated from sender, date, subject; can be used on links to track interactions.

So I'll use them to create a personalized phrase like this:

This is a reply to a message from {from}, sent on {date} to {to} and asking for reply on {replyto}.

Best,
